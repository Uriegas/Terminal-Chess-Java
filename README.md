## Chess Concepts  
**Checkmate** is a game position in which a player's king is in check (threatened with capture) and there is no way to avoid the threat.  

**Stalemate** is a situation in the game of chess where the player whose turn it is to move is not in check but has no legal move. When stalemate occurs, the game ends as a draw.

**Castling** is a move in the game of chess involving a player's king and either of the player's original rooks.  

**En passant** is a move in chess. It is a special pawn capture that can only occur immediately after a pawn makes a move of two squares from its starting square, and it could have been captured by an enemy pawn had it advanced only one square. The opponent captures the just-moved pawn "as it passes" through the first square. The result is the same as if the pawn had advanced only one square and the enemy pawn had captured it normally.  

**Promotion** in chess is a rule that requires a pawn that reaches the eighth rank to be replaced by the player's choice of a bishop, knight, rook, or queen of the same color.
